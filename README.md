CaptureActivity
===============

Very minor modifications to the Original Zxing Project from here https://code.google.com/p/zxing/source/browse/trunk/android
because the zxing app became too old and exists as standalone app. We need to bundle this into our app rather than it being a standalone app

Requires the google zxing library - https://code.google.com/p/zxing/ - Build from source and get the core.jar 
Add the core.jar as dependency and build this as an android library project
Bundle this library project with freenet app. This enables the QR functions
